# <Week 1 Challenge>

## Description

    This weeks challenge was an exciting one, we were tasked with updating the antiquated coding on a website for Horiseon Social Soultion Services. Much of the code used the Div element to segregate parts of the website so this projects primary focus was this: Replace it using semantic HTML 5 elements. This organizes the code in a way that is more consistent with todays standards, especially in regards to making the website more accessible overall.
